Much of the text provided in the UI elements in Blacklight are customizable using rails' [internationalization](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) (i18n).  Blacklight has [translations](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/tree/master/config/locales) for its UI in 5 languages besides english.  If you happen to find a piece of text that is provided by the Blacklight UI and **not** customizable via i18n please feel free to submit a pull request to fix it or file an issue in the [issue tracker](github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/issues/new).

In order to override the values provided by Blacklight you need to add keys in your application's locale YAML files (typically located in `config/locales`) for the languages that you would like to change.  For this example, you'll simply update the `blacklight.en.yml` file that was auto-generated into your application for you.  If you're developing a multi-lingual application you'll also want to update the same key in Blacklight's locale files for other languages.

The auto-generated `blacklight.en.yml` that is in your application has the `application_name` key that nearly every application will want to update.  This key is used as the HTML title in the `<head>` section as well as various other places.  If you change the `application_name` key your application will be updated with that value.  Note that only the single key is auto-generated in that file. You only need to override the keys you want to change and do not need to copy the entire contents of the file.

{% highlight yaml %}
en:
  blacklight:
    application_name: 'Blacklight'
{% endhighlight%}

In order to update other values you'll need to determine **which** key to override. For example, if you wanted to update the placeholder text in the search box, instead of overriding the view you can simply find the i18n key and override it in your application's `blacklight.en.yml` file.

<div class='image-well'>
  <img src='/public/images/blacklight-search-field.png' alt='Blacklight search box' />
  <div class='caption'>Default placeholder text in search input</div>
</div>

The partial for the search form is at `app/views/catalog/_search_form.html.erb` ([GitHub](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/blob/43415d28547d53df3cf7586c50a49a082dea7ba5/app/views/catalog/_search_form.html.erb#L11)). You can see that the `placeholder` attribute is `t('blacklight.search.form.search.placeholder')`. This means that if we re-construct that key hierarchy in our `blacklight.en.yml` file our value will be used instead of the one in Blacklight.

{% highlight yaml %}
en:
  blacklight:
    ...
    search:
      form:
        search:
          placeholder: 'Insert search terms here...'
{% endhighlight%}

<div class='image-well'>
  <img src='/public/images/updated-blacklight-search-field.png' alt='Updated blacklight search box' />
  <div class='caption'>Updated placeholder text in search input</div>
</div>

You have now used rails' internationalization library to make simple text updates to your Blacklight application without needing to override view partials.
