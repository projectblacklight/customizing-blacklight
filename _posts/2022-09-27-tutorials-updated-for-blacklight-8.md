title: Tutorials Updated for Blacklight 8!
---

In anticipation of the 2022 Virtual Blacklight Summit, we have been updating the tutorials here to be accurate for all the changes in the Blacklight 8 release (as well as adding additional useful content).

The navigation on the left has been updated to allow you to navigate the different versions available, and when within a particular version of tutorials navigate the various tutorials themselves.  Use the navigation on the left to browse the available versions or start with your [First Change in Blacklight 8](/v8.0.0.alpha/first_change/).

There is also a repository that we'll be using as part of an Intro to Blacklight pre-conference workshop that you may find useful to follow along with some of the content. [https://github.com/projectblacklight/intro-to-blacklight-2022](https://github.com/projectblacklight/intro-to-blacklight-2022)
