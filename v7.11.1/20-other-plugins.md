Because Blacklight is a configurable and extendable Ruby on Rails engine, other plugins exist for Blacklight that add additional functionality.  These plugins themselves are Ruby on Rails engines that usually require Blacklight as a dependency and inject custom behavior.

Often these plugins fall into two different categories: a plugin that provides custom functionality or a plugin that exists as a certain type of domain specific Blacklight application.

## Plugins that provide custom functionality
There are many more of these plugins that exist. An example of this would be [Blacklight Range Limit](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight_range_limit) which adds range limit slider facets to the facet views. These types of plugins are often used in conjunction with eachother.

## Plugins that provide a domain specific Blacklight application
These types of plugins provide a specific type of Blacklight application experience. Three of these exist including:
  - [Spotlight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight) -  Spotlight enables librarians, curators, and others who are responsible for digital collections to create attractive, feature-rich websites that highlight these collections. 
  - [GeoBlacklight](https://geoblacklight.org/) - A Blacklight based application built to aid with in discovery of geospatial data
  - [ArcLight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/arclight/) - Aimed at supporting discovery of archival material
  
  
Blacklight plugins exist as separate software projects, and can even have adjacent communities that help maintain them.
